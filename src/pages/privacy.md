beaconDB is a public database that collects location information about common wireless infrastructure, such as cell towers, Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth devices. beaconDB freely and openly publishes aggregated data for devices to estimate their location. Data I collect has been submitted by users for the explicit purpose of being aggregated and publicly shared. Various methods are used to obfuscate and remove any personal information from the data I publish, such as network names and MAC addresses.

**I do not sell any information I collect.**

I record HTTP server logs as part of maintaining my infrastructure. These logs include your IP address, the date and time, the URL requested and your browser's user agent.

When you access beaconDB using the beaconDB API, I do not record information that could be used to identify you or your location, such as the beacon data you request or your estimated location.

beaconDB supports initiatives by Google and Microsoft to opt-out of having your network included in their geolocation databases. beaconDB does not publish any information if your network name is hidden, includes `_nomap`, or includes `_optout`. If you'd like to remove information users have submitted about wireless infrastructure you own, please contact me using the information below.

When you submit data to beaconDB for the explicit purpose of being aggregated and publicly shared, I keep a copy of the original measurements you upload for improving data accuracy and quality control. I understand that the raw measurements you submit may include sensitive or identifying locations and I will not share any raw measurements with any third parties without your explicit approval beforehand. In the future, this data will be automatically anonymised and I will offer users increased control over the duration this data is stored for - [current status](https://github.com/beacondb/beacondb/issues/4).

**beaconDB is committed to protecting your personal information.** If you have any questions or conerns regarding how beaconDB handles your data, please contact me using [Signal](https://signal.me/#eu/IuRXDamWh4cYlxuHO-xbH5D4CVR3rOKG0fe0WKDcE7vqiAWM3xBASJOLGCa6O0Px) or [email](mailto:hello@joel.net.au). If you would like to discuss a possible security issue, please contact me securely on Signal. If you have ideas for how beaconDB can further protect personal information, please open a new issue in [beaconDB's public bug tracker](https://github.com/beacondb/beacondb/issues).
